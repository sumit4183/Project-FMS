# Project-FMS: Gaming Hub

A collection of interactive web-based mini-games built with **p5.js**. This project features three distinct challenges testing typing speed, cognitive reflexes, and mouse control. It demonstrates core game development concepts like collision detection, state management, and the game loop pattern without heavy frameworks.
